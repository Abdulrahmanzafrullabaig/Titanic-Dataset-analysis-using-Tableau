Titanic prediction dataset

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets used in machine learning and data visualization, often employed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and teaching purposes. It contains data about the passengers on board the RMS Titanic, which famously sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg. The dataset is popular for building models to predict survival based on various factors, as well as for visualizing and interpreting the results.

Overview of the Titanic Dataset

The Titanic dataset typically includes the following key features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
Survived: A binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or died (0).
Pclass: The class in which the passenger was traveling (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class).
Name: The name of the passenger.
Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).
Age: Age of the passenger.
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: The fare paid for the ticket.
Cabin: Cabin number, where available.
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Visualizing Survival Data in Tableau

Using Tableau to analyze the Titanic dataset helps in understanding the relationship between different variables and the survival outcome. Here's a step-by-step overview of how you might use Tableau to visualize and analyze the survival rates in the Titanic dataset:

1. Loading the Dataset into Tableau

Start by loading the Titanic dataset (often available as a CSV file) into Tableau.
Once loaded, Tableau will automatically recognize the columns (features) as dimensions and measures.

2. Creating a Simple Visualization of Survival Rates

Objective: To find out how many people survived versus how many died.
Drag the Survived variable to the Columns shelf.
Drag the PassengerId variable to the Rows shelf.
Convert the PassengerId field to count (by right-clicking on it and selecting "Measure > Count").
This will give you a simple bar chart showing the number of survivors and non-survivors.

3. Breaking Down Survival Rates by Class

Objective: To explore survival rates by passenger class.
Drag Pclass to the Columns shelf and Survived to the Rows shelf.
Drag PassengerId to the Rows shelf and convert it to count as before.
Add Pclass to the Color shelf to differentiate between the classes.
This visualization helps you see how survival rates varied between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class passengers.

4. Analyzing Survival by Gender

Objective: To analyze how gender affected survival.
Drag Sex to the Columns shelf along with Survived.
Drag PassengerId to the Rows shelf and convert it to count.
Add Survived to the Color shelf to distinguish between survivors and non-survivors.
This reveals that a higher proportion of women survived compared to men, reflecting the "women and children first" policy during the evacuation.

5. Further Analysis: 

Age, Embarkation, and Fare
You can also explore how other variables like Age, Embarked, and Fare impact survival.
Create histograms or box plots for Age and Fare and break them down by survival status.
Use the Embarked field to understand survival rates based on the port of embarkation.

Conclusion

Using Tableau to analyze the Titanic dataset allows you to uncover key insights about the passengers' survival rates based on various features such as class, gender, age, and fare. The visualizations make it easy to interpret the complex relationships between these factors, and they help you understand which variables were most significant in determining whether a passenger survived the disaster.
